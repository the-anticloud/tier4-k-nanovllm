## L5 Narrow
K_NANOVLLM is a lightweight, from-scratch vLLM-compatible inference engine optimized for the Kaggle T4 16GB GPU constraint. Narrow scope: PAX 27B Q4 and similar quantized models on T4/V100-class GPUs. Does not attempt A100-scale continuous batching.

## L2 General
L2 General: K_NANOVLLM is the primary inference backend for all Kaggle T4 deployments across all tiers. TIER_7 biosignal analysis and TIER_9 robotics planning both use K_NANOVLLM as the inference engine on T4 hardware.

## PAX 27B Integration
K_NANOVLLM IS the inference engine for PAX 27B on T4 hardware. PAX 27B Q4 quantized weights run through K_NANOVLLM's custom attention and sampling kernels, achieving ~97 tok/s on a single T4 GPU.

## AIOSS Audit Chain
Every inference batch (prompt hashes + completion hashes + throughput metrics + GPU stats) is chained: H_n = SHA3-256(H_{n-1} || entry_hash_n || timestamp_n).
Offline-verifiable, tamper-evident, zero cloud dependency.

## Regulatory / Compliance
No external regulatory. ISO/IEC 42001 for documented AI system constraints and capabilities.
